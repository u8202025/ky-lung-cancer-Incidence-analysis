In the downloaded spreadsheet (from url2), the three radon levels are described as follows:
Radon Zone Descriptions
Zone 1: Counties with predicted average indoor radon screening levels greater than 4 pCi/L
Zone 2: Counties with predicted average indoor radon screening levels from 2 to 4 pCi/L
Zone 3: Counties with predicted average indoor radon screening levels less than 2 pCi/L

My Radon Index is defined by swaping 1 and 3 to make it more intuitive:
The higher/lower the Randon index, the higher/lower the radon concentration, so:
Radon Index 1: Counties with predicted average indoor radon screening levels less than 2 pCi/L
Radon Index 2: Counties with predicted average indoor radon screening levels from 2 to 4 pCi/L
Radon Index 3: Counties with predicted average indoor radon screening levels greater than 4 pCi/L

On url3, the name of the second column
"Percentage Current Smokers" has been changed to "Percentage of Smokers".

On url4, the name of the second column
"Age-Adjusted Incidence Rate cases per 100,000" has been changed to "Cancer Incidence Rate (cases/100,000)".

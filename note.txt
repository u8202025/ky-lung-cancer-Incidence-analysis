* about Radon Index
url2 = 'https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/radon_zones-spreadsheet.xls'
In the downloaded spreadsheet (from url2), the three radon levels are described as follows:
Radon Zone Descriptions
Zone 1: Counties with predicted average indoor radon screening levels greater than 4 pCi/L
Zone 2: Counties with predicted average indoor radon screening levels from 2 to 4 pCi/L
Zone 3: Counties with predicted average indoor radon screening levels less than 2 pCi/L

My Radon Index is defined by swaping 1 and 3 to make it more intuitive:
The higher/lower the Randon index, the higher/lower the radon concentration, so the definition of Radon Index is:
Radon Index 1: Counties with predicted average indoor radon screening levels less than 2 pCi/L
Radon Index 2: Counties with predicted average indoor radon screening levels from 2 to 4 pCi/L
Radon Index 3: Counties with predicted average indoor radon screening levels greater than 4 pCi/L

* Rename the 2nd column of url3
url3 = "https://kyibis.mc.uky.edu/ehl/dataportal/indicator/view/TobaccoSmokeAdult.Cnty.html?fbclid=IwAR2fSGhwHNnxgaOy6w5GwfUqjHXLCHSyfS0cVQpglf7Ix4jvCcxgiEoyXYU"
On url3, the name of the second column
"Percentage Current Smokers" has been changed to "Percentage of Smokers".

* Rename the 2nd column of url4
url4 = 'https://statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/incidencerates/index.php?stateFIPS=21&areatype=county&cancer=047&race=00&sex=0&age=001&stage=211&type=incd&sortVariableName=rate&sortOrder=default&output=0&fbclid=IwAR0Fwok2ABQLH_Wmovm_Cj4UGPnyjj3fKQC3GzpV8tcfNPdyodKgbpq0d4A#results'
On url4, the name of the second column
"Age-Adjusted Incidence Rate cases per 100,000" has been changed to "Cancer Incidence Rate (cases/100,000)".
